I'm Marceau CNUDDE, a French guy trying to undertand how machine learning works, among other things.

### More Information

I studied math, physics and some computer science at Ecole Centrale Nantes. When MOOCs started to become trendy I was involved in their development in France. I am now focusing on machine learning and all artificial intelligence related issues, from neuroscience, philosophy and so on.
